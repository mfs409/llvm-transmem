/// p_alloc.h provides a set of allocation managers that can be used by a PTM
/// implementation.  These allocation managers all provide the same public
/// interface, so that they are interchangeable in PTM algorithms.
///
/// NB: We assume that there is some amount of recoverability in the system
///     allocator.  However, the AllocationManager object still needs to have
///     some amount of persistence to it.  We can assume that the recovery
///     algorithm will walk the heap and do reachability to reconstruct the free
///     list.  As a result, the AllocationManager object does not need to have a
///     persistent free list... if a transaction put something in its free list,
///     then it *should have* also performed enough writes to make that memory
///     unreachable.  If the system crashes before the transaction commits, then
///     during recovery run the undo log before reconstructing the freelist.
///     Since the frees didn't happen anyway, the data will be reachable, and
///     all is good.  If the system crashes after the transaction commits, then
///     first run the redo log.  Free'd data should then be unreachable, and
///     thus will be treated as free.
///
///     However, we need to handle mallocs.  When does a malloc need to be
///     undone?  It needs to be undone if the system crashes before the
///     transaction marks itself as done.  So, obviously, the list needs to be
///     persistent.  But that's not enough.  For an abort, we run the undo log,
///     then reclaim all in the malloc list.  For a commit, we run the redo log,
///     and then drop the malloc list.  But we have a fast-path for read-only
///     transactions, where they never toggle their state.  Can a read-only
///     transaction malloc?  Maybe.  It's likely that the transaction would have
///     to write a reference to its new memory *somewhere*, and wouldn't be
///     read-only.  If the system crashes when a transaction's state is
///     "inactive", but the malloc list is not empty, then we say that the
///     transaction did not commit, and we reclaim the mallocs.  If the list is
///     empty, then we say the transaction did commit, and we don't reclaim.  So
///     really, p_clear() is the point of durable linearizability for read-only
///     transactions that perform allocations.  This is especially subtle since
///     there will be p_precommit() calls.  But it appears to be sufficient for
///     recoverability, and also to ensure we incur all of the fence overheads
///     that one might expect.
///
///     The above logic does require us to split onCommit into commitMallocs and
///     commitFrees, because commitFrees must be after quiescence, whereas
///     commitMallocs must be before marking self complete.
