Introduction
------------

This benchmark implements a gene sequencing program that reconstructs the gene
sequence from segments of a larger gene.

For example, given the segments TCGG, GCAG, ATCG, CAGC, and GATC, the program
will try to construct the shortest gene that can be made from them.

For example, if we slide around the above segments we can get:

             TCGG
        GCAG
            ATCG
      CAGC
           GATC
     =============
      CAGCAGATCGG


This gives a final sequence of length 11. Another possible solution is:

        TCGG
           GCAG
       ATCG
            CAGC
      GATC
     =============
      GATCGGCAGC

This solution has length 10. Both are consistent with the segments provided,
but the second is the optimal solution since it is shorter.

The algorithm used to sequence the gene has three phases:

    1) Remove duplicate segments by using hash-set
    2) Match segments using Rabin-Karp string search algorithm [3]
       - Cycles are prevented by tracking starts/ends of matched chains
    3) Build sequence

The first two steps make up the bulk of the execution time and are parallelized.


Compiling and Running
---------------------

To build the application, simply run:

    make -f <makefile>

in the source directory. For example, for the sequential flavor, run:

    make -f Makefile.seq

By default, this produces an executable named "genome", which can then be
run in the following manner:

    ./genome -g <gene_length> \
             -s <segment_length> \
             -n <number_of_segments> \
             -t <number_of_threads>

To produce the data in [1] and [2], the following values were used:

    -g256 -s16 -n16384

For running without a simulator, use the default values:

    -g16384 -s64 -n16777216


Workload Size
-------------

The size of the workload is determined by the -g, -s, and -n options. The
gene sequencing example in "Introduction", would correspond to -g10 -s4 -n5.
In general, the values for these three options should follow the following
relationship: -s << -g << -n. Larger values increase the size of the workload.
