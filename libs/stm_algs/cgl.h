/// CGL is an STM algorithm with the following characteristics:
/// - All transactions are protected by a single coarse-grained lock, and thus
///   there is no concurrency among transactions.
/// - All writes are performed immediately.
///
/// CGL can be customized in the following ways:
/// - Lock implementation (spin lock, std::mutex, etc)
///
/// Note that while we template on the following, the options are limited by CGL
/// not taking instrumented code paths:
/// - Stack Frame (only used to manage transaction nesting)
/// - Allocator (to standardize malloc/free behavior across implementations)
