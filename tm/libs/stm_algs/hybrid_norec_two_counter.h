/// HybridNOrecTwoCounter is a Hybrid TM algorithm with the following
/// characteristics:
/// - It uses two counters for concurrency control: one is for HTM to notify STM
///   of commit, and one is for STM to notify STM of commit.
/// - HTM cannot commit during STM writeback
/// - Uses values for validation, instead of a lock table or other metadata
/// - Performs speculative writes out of place (uses redo)
///
/// HybridNOrecTwoCounter can be customized in the following ways:
/// - RETRY (HTM attempts that fail before falling back to STM)
/// - Redo Log (data structure and granularity of chunks)
/// - EpochManager (quiescence and irrevocability)
/// - Contention manager
/// - Stack Frame (to bring some of the caller frame into tx scope)
/// - Allocator (to become irrevocable on too many allocations)

        //     software transaction could take a segfault during validation
        //     (because of value-based validation).
        //
        //     It's not so easy, though: if the HTM transaction's free()
        //     actually returned memory to the OS, that would be a syscall, and
        //     the HTM transaction would have aborted.  So the HTM transaction
        //     must have freed something, and then some other thread must have
        //     freed something, and that second free must have led to a full
        //     page becoming free (a page that contained both of the regions
        //     that were freed).  Note that if the second freeing thread is STM,
        //     then it will quiesce, so we don't have anything to worry about.
        //     But if the second freeing thread is non-transactional, we have a
        //     problem.
        //
        //     A second possible problem is that the free() could be followed by
        //     a malloc() from a nontransactional thread, whose writes to the
        //     memory could then race with validation in a software transaction.
        //
        //     If we wanted to address the problems, we'd need HTM to take an
        //     instrumented path that deferred all frees(), so that we could
        //     xend, quiesce, and then free().  We are instead going to ignore
        //     the problem, because (a) it is likely that anyone using this TM
        //     is also using something like jemalloc, which never gives memory
        //     back to the OS, and (b) these problems don't manifest in any of
